	<h2>What is a dogs normal diet?</h2>
	</article>
<article class="item">
	<p>Before I go over what a dog’s diet is, I need to mention this.</p>
<p>Every dog is different, and there is no one true way to know what your dog can eat. You should always ask your veterinarian about what your dog can eat, and read only from trusted sources. In the case of this, the websites I have used for this will be at the bottom of this page.</p>

<p>Dr. Leigh from Your Vet Online advises that it is important to ensure your dog’s food is both complete and balanced for its stage of life, and if it has any medical issues.
The RSPCA, or the Royal Soiety for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (if you feel so inclined), says that it is entirely acceptable to feed your dog a pure kibble diet, or you can mix it up with some cooked or raw meat. Dr. Leigh suggests the following,</p>
<ul>
	<li>Choose human-grade meat as some pet meat and bone products will contain preservatives that can be bad for your dog’s health.</li>
	<li>Practice impeccable food hygiene as the risk of both you and your dog getting a food-borne bacterial infection such as campylobacter or salmonella is high</li>
	<li>Have a veterinary nutritionist formulate the diet for you. Many raw diets are not balanced appropriately for stage of life or medical conditions.</li>
</ul>

		<h2>The weird stuff dogs love to eat</h2>
			</article>
	<article class="item">
		<p>Let’s be honest, dogs love to eat. They are constantly wanting to eat whatever they can find. But what if I told you that there are people that feed their dogs some of the weirdest stuff imaginable, this includes...</p>
<ul>
	<li>Peanut Butter</li>
	<li>Cheese</li>
<li>Yogurt</li>
<li>Baby Carrots</li>
<li>Broccoli</li>
<li>Ice cubes</li>
<li>Banana</li>
<li>Watermelon</li>
		</ul>
<p>There are a lot more that I didn’t list, but these are just a few things that dogs love to eat that are… more or less weird.</p>
