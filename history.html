<article class="item">
<p>The history of how dogs got domesticated goes 15,000 years back, however, new evidence suggests that it was even later than that, between 27,000 to 40,000 years ago, when humans weren’t as abundant as they are now. Back then, they didn’t have as many breeds as we do now, in fact, they were domesticating wolves.</p>
<p>Wolves were first attracted to human camps to take whatever left overs they have, however over time, some wolves started to travel with the nomadic humans and a sort of natural selection of domestication occurred. Some scientists suggest that females may have been the first to domesticate the wolves.</p>
<p>Russian researcher Dmitri K. Belyaev ran a 40-year experiment and lead to him saying that it takes 6 to 8 generations to domesticate a canine. Keep in mind that the research was done in the 1950s.
