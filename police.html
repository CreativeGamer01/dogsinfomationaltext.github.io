	<h2>Why are dogs used in the police force?</h2>
<p>Police Dogs are a very important part of our police force, not only are they good at apprehending criminals, but their scent receptors are able to sniff out even the most cunning criminal.</p>

	<h2>Apprehension</h2>
	</article>
		<article class="item">
<p>This is one of the most important parts of why Police Dogs are used. They are trained to bite dangerous criminals and hold them hostage. In many situations, they are the first ones to risk their lives and go in against an armed suspect to protect their human partners. One of the qualities these types of police dogs will need is discipline, and a lot of it because they’ll need to know when someone is a threat and to act solely on the command of their handlers.</p>

	<h2>Detection</h2>

	<article class="item">
<p>Everyone on planet earth knows that dogs have an incredible sense of smell, after all, they have over 225 million scent receptors in their noses. We use this ability of theirs to our advantage when fighting crime. Police Dogs are often taught to detect various drugs, explosives, accelerants (when they are investigating arson), and other crime scene evidence. These types of dogs are often found in airports and border entries.</p>

	<h2>Search and Rescue</h2>
					</article>
	<article class="item">
<p>A large part of the police work is based around searching for lost, or missing victims. Whether it’s someone who has been kidnapped, or a missing person who has gotten lost. In the case of search and rescue, Police dogs are often trained to find living victims and the remains of deceased humans. They can cover miles and miles of forest to find a lost hiker, they can search through rubble after an earthquake and can even locate the bodies of drowned victims underwater in oceans and lakes. The ability to search a vastly large area in such a short amount of time is a great resource when time is of the essence.</p>
